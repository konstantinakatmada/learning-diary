A diary of my journey learning how to code ðŸ’»

Today, Thursday 20th October 2022, was the fourth consecutive day of working on Concurrency and Reqular Expressions at Execute Programme.
Execute Concurrency can be daunting, but Regular Expressions are refreshingly quick to do- even when solving the Quizzes.I realised I missed some related parts of Freecodecamp Courses, so I do go back to Freecodecamp when I need something easier to relax my mind. After all, for the last three days Execute keeps on giving me "Danger!" messages that say I have done far too many lessons and should take a break, and I keep clicking "One more lesson".
A snippet of a Function that I came up with for Execute Concurrency on the first day of my fourth-day streak:

Add another 'then' call to wrap the promise's string value in an array.

Promise.resolve(5)

  .then(n => n * 2)

  .then(n => n.toString())

  .then(n => [n]);

Async Result:

Goal:

    {fulfilled: ['10']}

Yours:

    {fulfilled: ['10']}
    The most important parts of the day though, came from some people who shared their knowledge. Fatimat Gbajabiamila, a Founders and Coders alumnus, shared her experience with us at the Founders and Coders bootcamp and answered all of our question.

    This week solidified my knowledge of the previous ones. My understanding of Promises was put to test with the Business Card generator, and I was relieved to see all the work of the previous two weeks helped my manage to render the results of an API, even if there was an unexpected issue to solve, as the case usually is when building an app or website. The particular challenge was how to get image results from an API returning JSON Objects.
