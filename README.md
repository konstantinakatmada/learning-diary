A diary of my journey learning how to code ðŸ’»

Today, Thursday 20th October 2022, was the fourth consecutive day of working on Concurrency and Reqular Expressions at Execute Programme.
Execute Concurrency can be daunting, but Regular Expressions are refreshingly quick to do- even when solving the Quizzes.I realised I missed some related parts of Freecodecamp Courses, so I do go back to Freecodecamp when I need something easier to relax my mind. After all, for the last three days Execute keeps on giving me "Danger!" messages that say I have done far too many lessons and should take a break, and I keep clicking "One more lesson".
A snippet of a Function that I came up with for Execute Concurrency on the first day of my fourth-day streak:

Add another 'then' call to wrap the promise's string value in an array.

Promise.resolve(5)

  .then(n => n * 2)

  .then(n => n.toString())

  .then(n => [n]);

Async Result:

Goal:

    {fulfilled: ['10']}

Yours:

    {fulfilled: ['10']}
